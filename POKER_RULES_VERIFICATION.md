# Texas Hold'em Rules Verification

This document verifies that our poker engine implementation matches official Texas Hold'em rules from poker.com.

## Hand Rankings (Highest to Lowest)

### 1. Royal Flush ✅
**Official Rule**: "Five card sequence from 10 to the Ace in the same suit (10,J,Q,K,A)"

**Our Implementation**:
- Detected as Ace-high Straight Flush in `HandEvaluator.checkRoyalFlush()`
- Cards: A-K-Q-J-T all same suit
- Primary value: 14 (Ace)
- ✅ **Verified**: `HandEvaluator.test.ts` lines 21-34

---

### 2. Straight Flush ✅
**Official Rule**: "Any five consecutive cards of identical suit. Ranking between straights is determined by the value of the high end of the straight."

**Our Implementation**:
- Checks for both flush and straight in `HandEvaluator.checkStraightFlush()`
- Stores high card value as `primaryValue`
- Handles wheel (A-2-3-4-5) with 5 as high card
- ✅ **Verified**: `HandEvaluator.test.ts` lines 36-73

**Special Case - The Wheel (A-2-3-4-5)**:
- Ace acts as low card (value 1)
- 5 is considered the high card
- ✅ Implemented in `getStraightHighCard()` method

---

### 3. Four of a Kind ✅
**Official Rule**: "All four cards sharing the same rank"

**Our Implementation**:
- Detects 4 cards with same rank in `HandEvaluator.checkFourOfAKind()`

- ✅ **Verified**: `HandEvaluator.test.ts` lines 75-94

---

### 4. Full House ✅

- Stores trips rank as `primaryValue`
- Stores pair rank as `secondaryValue`
- Comparison uses trips first, then pair
- ✅ **Verified**: `HandEvaluator.test.ts` lines 96-119

---

### 5. Flush ✅
**Official Rule**: "Any five cards of the same suit, but not in sequence. The highest card determines the winner when multiple players have a flush."

- Comparison done top-down on all 5 cards
- ✅ **Verified**: `HandEvaluator.test.ts` lines 121-142

---

### 6. Straight ✅

**Our Implementation**:
- Detects consecutive cards in `HandEvaluator.checkStraight()`
- Does NOT allow wrapping (Q-K-A-2-3 rejected)
- Allows wheel (A-2-3-4-5) where Ace is low
- Stores high card as `primaryValue`
- ✅ **Verified**: `HandEvaluator.test.ts` lines 144-176

**Special Cases Handled**:

- Wheel (5-4-3-2-A): 5 = high card, Ace acts as 1

---

### 8. Two Pair ✅
**Official Rule**: "Two separate pairs. The higher-valued pair breaks ties."

**Our Implementation**:
- Detects exactly 2 pairs in `HandEvaluator.checkTwoPair()`
- Stores higher pair as `primaryValue`
- Stores lower pair as `secondaryValue`
- Stores kicker as first element in `kickers` array
- Comparison: high pair → low pair → kicker
- ✅ **Verified**: `HandEvaluator.test.ts` lines 202-229

---

- Comparison done card-by-card from highest to lowest
- ✅ **Verified**: `HandEvaluator.test.ts` lines 259-279

---

## Hand Comparison Logic ✅

**Official Rule**: "The player with the best five-card poker hand wins the pot."

**Our Implementation** (`HandRanking.compareTo()`):
1. Compare hand rank (Royal Flush > ... > High Card)
2. If same rank, compare `primaryValue`
3. If still tied, compare `secondaryValue`
4. If still tied, compare `kickers` array element by element
5. Return 0 if completely identical

✅ **Verified**: `HandEvaluator.test.ts` lines 281-324

---

## Texas Hold'em 7-Card Evaluation ✅

**Official Rule**: Players make the best possible 5-card hand from 7 cards (2 hole + 5 community)

**Our Implementation** (`HandEvaluator.evaluateBest7CardHand()`):
- Generates all 21 possible 5-card combinations from 7 cards
- Evaluates each combination
- Returns the best hand

✅ **Verified**: `HandEvaluator.test.ts` lines 326-378

---

## Edge Cases Handled ✅

### Ace Duality
- **High in Broadway**: A-K-Q-J-T (Ace = 14)
- **Low in Wheel**: 5-4-3-2-A (Ace = 1, high card = 5)
- ✅ Correctly implemented

### Tie Breaking
- **Same hand type**: Compare primary value
- **Same primary**: Compare secondary value
- **Same secondary**: Compare kickers in order
- ✅ Correctly implemented

### Invalid Hands
- **Wrapped straights rejected**: Q-K-A-2-3 is NOT a straight
- **Must be exactly 5 cards**: Throws error otherwise
- ✅ Correctly validated
